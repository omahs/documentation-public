  <Accordion title="What is Orderly?">
Orderly Network is a combination of an orderbook-based trading infrastructure and a robust liquidity layer offering spot and perpetual futures orderbooks. Unlike traditional platforms, Orderly doesn’t have a front end; instead, it operates at the core of the ecosystem, providing essential services to projects built on top of it.

Our DEX white-label solution is carefully crafted to save builders time and capital while granting access to our bootstrapped liquidity. Picture having the best features of CEXs while keeping settlements on-chain and maintaining full self-custody.

With Orderly, anyone can create a trading application thanks to our seamless plug-and-play experience leveraging our liquidity and composability.

Looking ahead, our grand vision is to create an omnichain protocol, connecting traders from both EVM and non-EVM chains within the same orderbook.

   <Accordion title="How to integrate?">

Documentation and examples for these can be found on their respective GitHub repositories and the official documentation site.

  Fees builders collect on top of Orderly base fee are collected by Orderly directly at the time of the trade. Rebates are then sent to each builder's admin wallet account daily.

To claim the rebate, builders need to log in on their own interface with the admin wallet and withdraw.

  admin authentication will note that in the API page description.
