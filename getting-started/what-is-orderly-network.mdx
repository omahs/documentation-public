## Introduction

Orderly Network is a combination of an orderbook-based trading infrastructure and a robust liquidity layer offering spot and perpetual futures orderbooks. Unlike traditional platforms, Orderly doesn't have a front end; instead, it operates at the core of the ecosystem, providing essential services to projects built on top of it.

Our DEX white-label solution is carefully crafted to save builders time and capital while granting access to our bootstrapped liquidity. Picture having the best features of CEXs while keeping settlements on-chain and maintaining full self-custody. 

With Orderly, anyone can create a trading application thanks to our seamless plug-and-play experience leveraging our liquidity and composability.

Looking ahead, our grand vision is to create an omnichain protocol, connecting traders from both EVM and non-EVM chains within the same orderbook.

## Products

### Spot trading (NEAR only)

This is the most basic type of trading, where users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Spot trading on Orderly Network is designed to be fast, secure, and user-friendly, with features like real-time market data, a unified order book, and trading charts.

### Perpetual futures trading (NEAR and EVM)

Perpetual Futures Trading is a form of derivatives trading that allows users to trade on the future price of an asset without actually owning it. Orderly Network offers perpetual futures contracts for cryptocurrencies, which are settled in USDC. This product enables users to trade with leverage, meaning they can open larger positions than they would be able to with their available capital.

A decentralized platform that enables users to generate yield by lending to pre-approved market makers and institutions in the Orderly ecosystem.

The community pool is a single-sided liquidity provision program meant to power and boost available liquidity across the markets.

The token auction will provide a secure and reliable infrastructure for Token Suppliers (anyone who wants to list their token on Orderly) to negotiate loan terms with Borrowers and perform diligence while also ensuring that only approved Market Makers will use staked tokens to make markets on the protocol, helping with new token listings.

## The move toward an omnichain future

DeFi has been one of the fastest-growing sectors in the blockchain industry, providing users with access to various financial services without third-party custodians, mitigating the principal-agent problems. However, DeFi is facing issues of composability, where users have to bridge funds when they want to access certain dApps or ecosystems. This can be complex and time-consuming.

The next iteration of Orderly will enable seamless trading between users on different chains in the same orderbook. No bridging, no complexities, just deposit the funds and start trading.

This opens up new opportunities for everyone building on Orderly Network to gain visibility, attract users, and foster growth. With the ability to interact with multiple blockchains, developers can leverage the strengths and features of different networks, creating a more robust and versatile DeFi ecosystem.

Despite our roots in NEAR, we embrace a multi-chain world. NEAR is our birthplace and our stronghold, but we aim to cater to all builders, many of whom operate on EVM. While NEAR remains central to Orderly, our multi-chain expansion is on the horizon.
