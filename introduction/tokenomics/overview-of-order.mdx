title: "Overview of ORDER"
---

The Orderly Network presents a fresh approach to decentralized finance (DeFi), emphasizing efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity. At the core of its ecosystem lies the \$ORDER token, crafted to decentralize the protocol, propel network expansion, incentivize user engagement, and uphold the platform's economic stability. Leveraging blockchain advancements, the Orderly Network strives to meet the rigorous demands of global financial systems by enabling swift and secure transactions while upholding decentralization principles.

The \$ORDER tokenomics are designed to foster a robust and sustainable ecosystem, aligning the interests of all stakeholders through a thoughtful distribution strategy and incentive mechanisms. This strategy not only supports governance and staking activities but also bolsters liquidity and fosters community involvement. Through this model, the Orderly Network aims to establish an equitable economic environment where value is fairly distributed, and contributions are duly acknowledged.

The economic ecosystem of the Orderly Network comprises a diverse range of participants, each playing a vital role in supporting and advancing the platform's DeFi objectives. Market makers, traders, \$ORDER holders, and builders are central to this ecosystem, ensuring liquidity, dynamism, and innovation within the network, thereby securing its success and long-term viability. Let's delve into the roles of these key economic actors:
- **Market Makers** : Market makers (or liquidity providers) furnish liquidity to the markets, reducing price fluctuations and facilitating seamless transactions for users. By placing buy and sell orders in the orderbooks of Orderly Network's trading infrastructure, they enable traders to execute orders efficiently, without causing significant price shifts. Market makers are motivated by trading profits and liquidity provision rewards, distributed in \$ORDER tokens. This setup encourages the continuous provision of liquidity, vital for the network's operational efficiency and user satisfaction.
- **Traders** : Traders actively participate in buying and selling assets on the Orderly Network, contributing to the network's dynamism and price discovery processes by seizing market opportunities. Interacting with the liquidity provided by market makers, traders boost the network's trading volume and indirectly enhance its liquidity depth. While seeking profits, traders also play a pivotal role in determining the fair value of assets within the ecosystem.
- **\$ORDER Holders** : \$ORDER holders possess the native token of the Orderly Network, entitling them to a stake in its future. Beyond speculative interests, holding \$ORDER tokens grants individuals the right to partake in governance decisions, influencing the platform's direction and policies. The commitment of \$ORDER holders to holding and utilizing \$ORDER tokens bolsters the network's stability and governance integrity.
- **Builders** : Builders are the masterminds behind the applications and services operating on the Orderly Network. They develop decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and protocols that enhance the network's functionality and use cases. As the Orderly Network serves as an infrastructure layer, builders are instrumental in driving innovation within the ecosystem, fostering adoption through user-friendly applications, and leveraging the network's capabilities to solve real-world challenges. Incentives for developers may include grants, dApp fees, or funding from the network's treasury for projects that significantly contribute to the ecosystem's growth.

The synergy among market makers, traders, \$ORDER holders, and builders cultivates a collaborative environment conducive to growth and innovation. Market makers and traders maintain network liquidity and activity, \$ORDER holders provide governance and security, while builders drive continuous innovation and utility. Together, these actors form a resilient and dynamic ecosystem that underpins the Orderly Network's mission to revolutionize DeFi through inclusivity, efficiency, and user empowerment.

## $ORDER Token Utility

\$ORDER token utilities are deeply integrated into the platform to create a flywheel effect, driving platform adoption and aligning the interests of various stakeholders.

1. **Governance Rights**: \$ORDER staking empowers token holders to partake in decentralized governance over key aspects of the Orderly Network as the governance process is formalized. Further details will be announced in due course.
2. **Earning VALOR**: VALOR measures a user's \$ORDER staking position in terms of amount and duration, entitling users to a corresponding share of the protocol treasury.
3. **Boosting Trading Reward**: By staking \$ORDER, traders receive a higher share of the trading rewards.
4. **Boosting Market Making Reward**: Staking \$ORDER enables market makers to receive a higher share of the market making rewards.
5. **Other Utilities**: Additional \$ORDER token utilities will be introduced in Orderly Network's upcoming products and third-party DeFi protocols.
