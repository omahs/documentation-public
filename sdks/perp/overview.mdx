`@orderly.network/perp`

A library of calculation formulas related to Orderly futures trading. This library is designed to be purely functional, with no context dependencies. Simply call the appropriate functions directly for seamless integration.

## Install

```sh
npm install @orderly.network/perp
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { maxQty, liqPrice } from "@orderly.network/perp";
import { OrderSide } from "@orderly.network/types";

// calculation of the maximum allowable position size for an account
const myMaxQty = () => {
  const qty = maxQty("PERP_ETH_USDC", OrderSide.BUY);
  console.log(qty); //
};

// calculation of the liquidation price of a position
const myLiqPrice = () => {
  const price = liqPrice(
    25986.2, //markPrice
    1981.66, // total collateral
    0.2, // positions size
    0.05 //MMR
  );
  console.log(myLiqPrice);
};
```

<Note>
  If you are a React developer, we recommend utilizing our React Hooks
  library:[`@orderly.network/hooks`](/sdks/hooks/overview). It encapsulates all the calculation
  formulas, and the hook internally manages the required data for computations.
