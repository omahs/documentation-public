<Warning>
Orderly will implement a tiered fee structure based on a 30-day volume (separately for Spot and Futures). The fee structure can also be retrieved with our REST API.
</Warning>

<Note>
Fees are subject to change at any time.
</Note>

Brokers also have the ability to set custom fees. Please [reach out](mailto:support@orderly.network) to us if you are looking to set custom fees for your platform.

## Spot Trading Fees

| Tier | 30-day Spot volume | Maker  | Taker  |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1    | \$0-\$500K           | 0.100% | 0.100% |
| 2    | \$500K-\$3M          | 0.080% | 0.090% |
| 3    | \$3M-\$10M           | 0.060% | 0.080% |
| 4    | \$10M-\$50M          | 0.040% | 0.070% |
| 5    | \$50M-\$100M         | 0.020% | 0.060% |
| 6    | Above \$100M        | 0.000% | 0.050% |

Spot trading fees are deducted from the converted token (e.g. converting USDC to ETH will incur fees in ETH)
